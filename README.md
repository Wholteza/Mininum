# Mininum
Custom keyboard (Numpad)

## The idea
The idea is to make a minimalistic numpad that you can carry with you anywhere, mainly for people taking their keyboards to/from work every day. In addition to that the minimum form factor is decided to fit the Planck made by Jack Humbert over at [OLKB](http://olkb.com), as that is my current favorite keyboard.

## Dimensions
- Height: 14mm (Case only, without silicon feet)
- Length: 81mm
- Width: 81mm
- Holes: 14\*14mm (Cherry MX compatible)

## Controller and firmware
The Mininum will use the QMK or TMK firmware flashed onto a microcontroller. The plan is program a layout according to the layout below to start with. The code will be in this repo. The controller itself will be either a teensy 2.0 or some kind of arduino clone. To keep the cost down the switches will be handwired and soldered directly to the pcb of the controller.

## Layout

* Middle text = Standard layer (NUMLOCK ON)
* Upper text  = Function layer
* Lower text  = Standard layer (NUMLOCK OFF)
* No text some of the layers = Transparent key (Same as standard layer)

## Todo
- [ ]  Check if anyone is interested in a group buy.
  - [ ]  What does it cost?
  - [ ]  Decide the choices of material used (3D-printed in PLA or water cut out of stainless steel)
- [ ]  Make a prototype out of water cut stainless steel.
  - [ ]  What does it weigh?
  - [ ]  Can i get any kind of finishing/treatment on the plates?
- [ ]  How can i get bluetooth compatibility and will it fit?
- [ ]  Check if the layout is compatible with different keycap profiles
- [ ]  Test the layout on a prototype
- [X] 3D-print a prototype (OLD MODEL)
  - [Pictures of the prototype (OLD MODEL)](http://imgur.com/a/AxiZH)
    - 3 parts: Bottom plate, frame and top plate.
    - Material: PLA (3D-printed)
  - [ ] 3D-print a new prototype
- [X] CAD the model (OLD MODEL)
  - [ ] CAD the new model

## Old model
The old model looks the same as the current except for the ENTER key being 2x1, covering the current ENTER and DELETE.

Could be reused if someone wants a bigger ENTER key. Though it lacks the space for a function key, reducing its number of possible keys from 31 to 16.
